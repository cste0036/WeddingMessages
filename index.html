                                on us. It really opened my eyes and gave me a new perspective, and made me want to be a better teacher too. You're a dependable, empathetic guy, fun to be around, and you were always a very good friend. I wish you and your
                                partner a happy future, with a lot of adventures, good food, good drinks, and good friends.</p>

                            <p class="c-message-p ">Congratulations! I cannot overstate how happy we all are for you both. Robin, having you as a friend for the past three years has been a privilege. Sitting down and talking with you every Saturday has meant the world. I wrote
                                my feelings in a toast to you both, so bear with me: Before I met Robin, I hadnâ€™t met many Canadians, but I always had stereotypes of them as polite, soft-spoken, and peaceful. Robin has confirmed all but the last of these
                                stereotypes. The man chooses violence in the morning. Youâ€™d know if youâ€™d seen him around Rugby season. The giddiness and excitement before watching a match. I had never seen the man with a broader grinâ€¦ except when he
                                talked about Adriana. But Robin didnâ€™t just meet these seeming requirements to be Canadian. He raises the bar for what it means to be a man. You can tell that he genuinely cares for those around him. Whenever you need an
                                ear to bend, Robin is quick to volunteer. His calming and soothing nature balances uncertainty and summons strength in an often chaotic world. He carries a lot of weight on his shoulders. It is inspiring and confusingly
                                emasculating at the same time. When youâ€™ve come to know a friend like Robin, along with great reverence comes deep worry for his well-being. Who can give him the same care and support that he needs? That Adriana is where
                                I want to give you a heartfelt thank you. Your presence in his life and the force of good you manifest is nothing short of a godsend. You give him the gift that someone like Robin truly needs: permission to be human. You
                                challenge and inspire him to improve by being your lovely and authentic self. That is truly heroic. Here's to a lifetime of love, happiness, and beautiful memories together. Cheers to Robin and Adriana.</p>

                            <p class="c-message-p ">I have known Robin for a long time, and I believe this photo is a perfect representation of our friendship. It has been one of repeated humiliations. Annihilations, crushing defeats and unprecedented losses to yours truly.
                                Like Hannibal crossing the alps with his elephants, I rode my way into Robins life and brought with me untold pain. Victory was sweet. And yet, on the eve of Robinâ€™s wedding, I have come to realise that this sneaky so-and-so
                                has been winning all along. Robin has built himself a life full to the brim with happiness, laughter and love. He has found his forever person, and together they are building a life anyone would envy. He has grown tremendously
                                since I met him, and he was already from day one perhaps the kindest, most thoughtful person I had ever met. I honestly cannot wait to see where the two of you of continue to go from here. And I cannot thank Adrianna enough
                                for coming into one of my closest friends lives and bringing him so much untold joy, for supporting him and overall being such a wonderful person. Enjoy this victory, Robin. You have well and truly earned it.</p>
